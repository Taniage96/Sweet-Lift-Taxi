# Taxi Orders Prediction Project

## Project Description

The Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for this prediction.

The RMSE metric on the test set should not exceed 48.

## Project Instructions

1.  Download the data and resample it so that each data point from the original data falls within one-hour intervals.
2.  Analyze the data.
3.  Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial dataset.
4.  Test the data using the test sample and provide a conclusion.

## Data Description

The data is stored in the file `/datasets/taxi.csv`. Download the dataset.
The number of orders is in the `num_orders` column.
